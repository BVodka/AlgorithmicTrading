# Algorithmic-Trading

A repository containing practice examples of algorithmic trading strategies as well as novel trading ideas.
Algorithmic strategies can be categorised as follows:

**1. Momentum strategies:**

• Provide good results in rising markets.
• Focus on stocks that have a certain trend on a high volume.
• For momentum strategies, price differences are calculated at fixed time
intervals.

**2. Mean-reversion strategies:**

• Assets are expected to eventually return to their mean levels or equilibrium
levels.
• If market price < average value, the asset is considered attractive as it is
expected to increase (Buy signal).
• If market price > average value (Sell signal).

**3. News-based trading:**

• This form of trading relies on algorithms to identify key words from Twitter,
Facebook, Bloomberg, blogs and different websites in order to obtain trading
signals.
• There is a recent boom in this type of trading due to the development of
machine learning algorithms for text analysis and the huge amount of free
data on the internet.
• Some companies sell data for market analysis (Sentdex).

**4. Statistical arbitrage:**

• The algorithms identify arbitrage opportunities (small price discrepancies of the
same asset on different markets).
Event arbitrage
• Certain events, such as company mergers or takeovers, or even company
restructuring, are considered to generate certain asset price/return patterns.

**5. Pairs trading:**

• It is difficult to find a tradable asset that has mean-reverting behavior.
• Equities behave like Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) and make the meanreverting trade strategies relatively useless.
• Pairs trading is the simplest form of mean reverting strategy.
• Pairs trading involves trading the stocks from two companies in the same that
sector (for example Pepsi and Coca Cola stock; Renault and Peugeot-Citroen
group). Stock prices are influenced mainly by the same shocks. Their relative
stock prices will diverge due to certain events but will revert to the long-running
mean.

**6. Pure quant trading and Excel:**

There is a recent trend to look down on Excel as it is not considered a pure quantitative
tool. Is Excel good for algorithm trading? Well, it depends. If the algorithms require
sophisticated calculations and high speed of transaction, then Excel may not be the
right tool. Excel can be an excellent tool for basic algorithm trading strategies and 
lower frequency transactions. It can also be used to check how different basic
algorithms perform. It is also good when you want to have access to data instantly.
