    "Trading correlated stocks means trading a pair of stocks that are highly correlated , i.e. the stocks move in the same direction most of the situations. **Trading opportunities** arise when the two stocks move temporarily in the opposite directions, i.e. the have weakened correlation for that particular period\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Rightarrow$ *one stock $\\uparrow$, the other stock $\\downarrow$.*\n",

    "\n",
    "- The spread can be a stationary time series, therefore a trader can use an **ARMA** model to predict the spread\n",
    "\n",
    "- The spread can also be traded separately\n",
    "\n",
    "- There may ne a cointergrating relationship between the two stocks, considering the high correlation coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If two stocks are highly correlated that does not mean they will remain highly correlated in the long run, i.e. their correlation may weakin in time."
